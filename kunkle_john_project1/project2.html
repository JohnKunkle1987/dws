		<h2 id ="1">Quick History</h2>
		
		<p> 	The waters around Florida have been swarming with ships for more than 6,000 years. American Indians used 
		dugout canoes to travel up and down Florida's rivers and around the coast. When the Spanish first explored and 
		later colonized Cuba and the Florida Panhandle, their wooden-hulled sailing ships were common sights in Florida's waters. 
		Until the advent of railroads on the Florida Peninsula, ships and boats were vital to the development of the region as they 
		were the most efficient means of transporting goods and passengers. Ever since the earliest European contact with the American
	 	continents, Florida has been a converging point for maritime trade routes connecting Europe, North America, the Caribbean, 
	 	Central and South America and the Gulf of Mexico. Traversing Florida's waters could be hazardous; the water currents, 
	 	offshore geography and geological hazards, including the Florida Reef and the Gulf Stream, traversed with narrow, 
	 	shallow channels, are compounded by powerful hurricanes, and have caused many ships to founder and wreck. Not surprisingly, 
	 	there are a large number of shipwrecks in the seas surrounding Florida. These vessels are time capsules from an earlier age 
		 and contain a wealth of information on the history of commerce and transport in Florida and the greater Caribbean area.

		<p>     Most of the <strong>shipwrecks</strong> listed in this travel itinerary are easily accessible and fascinating dive locations. Some of 
	    the shipwrecks are located within Dry Tortugas National Park, the <abbr title="Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary"> 
	    FKNMS</abbr> or one of Florida's Underwater Archeological Preserves. The others are within the territorial waters of the United States and 
	    under the jurisdiction of the state of Florida. Near most of these shipwrecks visitors will find local dive shops with 
	    further information, mooring buoys, marked underwater trails, laminated underwater maps for diving and snorkeling, 
	    shore-based exhibits with artifacts that interpret the sites for divers and non-divers alike and brochures. Except for 
	    the Maple Leaf (closed to divers), all sites are within generally accepted safe recreational diving limits and everyone 
	    is welcome to explore the sites, enjoy the surrounding undersea marine life and learn more about Florida's exciting 
	    maritime history. As with all historical and archeological sites on public uplands or submerged bottomlands, the 
	    shipwrecks are protected in accordance with Federal and/or Florida laws. The government agencies responsible for their 
	    management have established programs for their preservation, protection and interpretation, and for authorizing any 
	    excavation, disturbance or removal of artifacts. Living coral also are protected by law in Florida and must not be 
	    disturbed. It is important to remember that many of these shipwrecks have been damaged or are in an advanced stage of 
	    deterioration due to their being submerged for so many years. Divers today can help preserve these wrecks for future 
	    generations by not touching or removing anything from the shipwrecks or disturbing the surrounding sediment or marine 
	    life. When diving, always display the "diver down" flag and use mooring buoys to prevent anchor damage to the wreck sites.
